-   BE - API route POST /translate - given the article content in the body, it should return the translated version.
-   BE - API route POST /finetune - user should be able to upload multiple article original & translated versions & these should be stored in memory and used in the translate.

## Hackathon template

This template is intended for experimenting with agentic AI applications.
It permits starting simple yet with ample room to grow to production grade.

### FastAPI structure

The FastAPI server is in `/fastapi`. Its goal is to implement and expose the
primary backend of the application including LangChains via LangServe and/or
LlamaIndex and/or HuggingFaces. If beneficial, this FastAPI server can also
host secondary frontends such as Streamlit implementations for data analysis.

The Prisma Project is owned by the FastAPI server. Prisma Migrations must be
deployed along with the FastAPI server and the Prisma Schema resides within it.
However, for expediency, the Next App is _also_ able to read and write the
database via Prisma Models generated in TypeScript within the Next App.

The FastAPI server has this folder structure:

```txt {6-10,14-15}
fastapi
├── prisma (Prisma ORM Project)
│   ├── schema.prisma (Prisma DB Schema)
│   └── ...
├── src (Backend-focused Sources)
│   ├── app.py
│   └── ...
├── tests (Unit & Integration Tests)
└── pyproject.toml
```

### Next App structure

The Next.js App is in `/nextapp`. Its goal is to implement and expose the
primary frontend of the application as well as any backends-for-frontend
and/or secondary backends, such as NextAuth, where implementing them as part
of the Next App streamlines and accelerates development versus alternatives.

To help kickstart application development, the ShadCN UI CLI has been pre-configured.

For expediency, the Next App is able to read and write the database via generated
Prisma Models although it does _not_ own the Prisma Project. This provision permits
permit packages such as NextAuth to be adopted in an expedient fashion, by sharing
the pre-existing Prisma Project and database setup owned by the FastAPI server.

The Next App has this folder structure:

```txt {6-10,14-15}
nextapp
├── app (App Router)
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── ...
├── components (React Components)
